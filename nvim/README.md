# Lazyvimed
----------

### Introduction
- This is neovim config namely as Lazyvimed
- fork version of [ Lazyvim ](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation)
- This config is made for personal use only . but still , feel free to use 
- And as for keymaps Lazyvimed use which key so you can figure it out easily !
- Also it uses [Lazy.vim](https://lazy.folke.io/) plugin manager which is beautiful and works well 
- [folke , oh folke , oh my boy folke](https://youtu.be/ZWWxwwUsPNw?t=505). you get it right 
- i tried to create a config for nvim but i failed miserably .
- so i forked lazyvim, disabled some plugin and added some more plugin i like  .
----------
### Installation
- Lets get straight to the point
- ****Installation****
- Follow the below mention steps 
----------
### Before Installation
- make sure to create a backup of your current nvim config
```bash
# required
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```
- or remove your config if you are risky enough 
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
```
----------
### Steps

```bash
mkdir .config/nvim
git clone https://github.com/hellopradeep69/Lazyvimed.git ~/.config/nvim/

```

2. window

- may god have mercy on you ;-)
- just use your boring vs code .
----------
### After Installation
- Remove the .git folder, so you can add it to your own repo later
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```
- Remove README.md [ you dont need that ]
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/README.md
```

```nvim
